# Ideas for CS112

- Pedagogy
  - We only have so many hours of the students' time
    - I would rather they spend that time writing code than reading a book
    - 2 hours in lecture
    - 2 hours on labs (small practice problems on lecture material)
    - 5 hours on projects (larger problems they write from scratch)
      - or 4 hours on projects with an addition hour on Fridays in lecture
        - preferrably not new content, but perhaps more live coding, or help with the project
        - remember, they take longer to code even simple things.
        
  - Teach line-upon-line and give the students practice with each line
    - MW lectures
  - TTh labs on lecture material - should be completable in class
    - F Project day - discuss the project, give time to work on it, answer questions
  - Only teach what is needed - do not distract from key ideas with excess information
  - Teach what is true, correct, and best practice
    - Do not teach bad patterns or design because it is simpler
  - Java
    - Java as a language is a response to C++
      - But our students haven't learned C++ yet, so we need another way to motivate Java
    - Java is more performant than Python
      - Demo for loop runtimes?
      - Threading
      - Market: Java still has an large market share and is very relevant to your career
    
        
- Java 17
  - Java 5 is 18 years old!
- JUnit is a good choice (but should teach JUnit 5)
- Java script mode to get started
- Spring Boot?
  - So much of modern Java is Spring Boot, and it sure makes many things easier...
- Maven?
- Teach interfaces first, then abstract classes

- Intro to Java
  - Types
  - Syntax
  - 

Other topics?
  - Switch (expressions, statements)
  - Pattern matching?
  - 

- CS 111
  - Overlap with 235
    - Recursion well covered
    - List and dictionaries
    - Iterators (and generators)
    - Linked lists
      - Nodes to nodes
    - Trees
      - Nodes to nodes
      - Intro to tree traversal
  - Other stuff
    - Higher order
    - Objects/inheritance
      - polymorphism
    - Recursive objects
    - Decompsition and testing
    - Exceptions
    - Regular expressions
    - Intro to type annotations
  - Projects
    - HOG - dice game with high-order functions
    - CATS - spell-checking kind of thing
    - ANTS - OO programming
    - Scheme interpreter
  - Brett's wish list for 112
    - Polymorphism (interfaces; NOT for code re-use)
