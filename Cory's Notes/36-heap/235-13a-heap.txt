Binary Heaps (8.5)

What's a Binary Heap?
	1. a complete binary tree
	2. obeys the Heap order property

What's a Complete Binary Tree?
	1. all levels except the bottom are completely filled
	2. nodes at the bottom level are as far left as possible

Draw an example of a complete binary tree on the board.

What's the height of a complete binary tree?

What's the Heap order property?
	for every node n
	the value of n's parent is <= the value of n

Inserting Into a Heap

How do you Insert an item into a Heap?
	1. add an item at the next position at the bottom of the heap
	2. percolate up until the order is correct

How do you percolate up?
	1. compare an item with its parent
	2. swap if the parent is larger

What's the Big-Oh for Insert?
	O(log n) in the worst case
	O(1) in the average case


Removing From a Heap

How do you Remove an item from a Heap?
	1. replace the root with the last item
	2. percolate down until the order is correct

How do you percolate down?
	1. compare an item with its smaller child
	2. swap if the parent is larger

Implementing a Heap

How is a Binary Heap typically implemented?
	because the tree is complete,
	it can be stored efficiently in an array

How do you store a Tree in an array?
	store the nodes in level order

	1-based indexing
	the root is at A[1]
	the children of the root are at A[2] and A[3]

	0-based indexing
	the root is at A[0]
	the children of the root are at A[1] and A[2]

Draw the tree diagram for the Binary Heap on the board.
	4 4 6 5 4 9 8 5 8

Where can you find the children of the node at A[i]?
	1-based indexing
	the left child of the node at i is at 2i
	the right child of the node at i is at 2i+1

	0-based indexing
	the left child of the node at i is at 2i+1
	the right child of the node at i is at 2i+2

Where can you find the parent of the node at A[i]?
	1-based indexing
	the parent of the node at i is at i/2

	0-based indexing
	the parent of the node at i is at (i-1)/2
