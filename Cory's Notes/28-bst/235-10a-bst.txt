Binary Search Trees (8.4)

What's a Binary Search Tree?

What's the average-case time for finding an item in a List?
	O(n)

What's the average-case time for finding an item in a BST?
	O(log n)

How many steps are needed to find an item in a 1,000,000-item List?
	an average of 500,000 steps

How many steps are needed to find an item in a 1,000,000-item BST?
	an average of 20 steps


The BST Order Property

What's the defining property of a Binary Search Tree?
	for every node in the tree
	  items in the left subtree are smaller
	  items in the right subtree are larger

Draw an example BST on the board.

	     5
	    / \
	   3   6
	  / \   \
	 1   4   9
	  \     /
	   2   7
	        \
		 8

Searching

How do you find an item in a Binary Search Tree?
	compare the item to the root
	if smaller, repeat in the left subtree
	if larger, repeat in the right subtree

BST Time Analysis
What's the time for find, insert, and remove on a BST?

What characteristic of the tree affects the time?

What's the height of a BST with N nodes?

What's the best-case height of a BST with N nodes?
	the tree is balanced
	the height is O(log N)
	find, insert, and remove are O(log N)

What's the worst-case height of a BST with N nodes?
	the tree is like a linked list
	the height is O(N)
	find, insert, and remove are O(N)

What's the average-case height of a BST with N nodes?
	the average case is 38% worse than the best case
	the height is still O(log N)
	find, insert, and remove are O(log N)

What happens if you insert a sorted sequence of items into a BST?
